# Example websocket webapp
- Built for simple showcase
- Used [NG6-starter](https://github.com/gdi2290/NG6-starter) for boilerplate

# Notes
- This was my first experience with Angular 1.x.
- Learning and completion of app was done in 5 hours.
- No custom directives or services used.
- Tests have been updated from boilplates tests to include minimal cases created.
- Styling was all pure css, no framework used.

#### Assumptions
- User did not need to clear echo.
- User needed no other functionality other than echo.

#### Potential improvements
- Better/more test coverage.
- Include more possibilities for user interaction
